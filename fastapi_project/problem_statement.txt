In this challenge, your task is to implement a simple REST API to manage a collection of stock trades
each trade is a JSON entry with the following keys
id: the unique trade ID (integer)
type: The trade type, either "buy" or "sell"
user _id : The unique user id (integer)
symbol: The stock symbol (string)
shares: The total number of shares traded. The shares value traded is between 10 and 30 shares, inclusive(integer)
price
timestamp



The model implementation is already provided and is in read only mode


It has a time stamp field of date time type, which must be serealised to/from Json timestamp of integer type.

The task is to implement the rest service exposes /trades/ endpoint which allows for managing the collection of trade records in the following way:

Post request to /trades/:

1. Creates a new trade
2. Expects a JSON trade object without an ID property as a body pay load. You can assume that the given object is always valid
3. Adds the given trade object to the collection of trades and assigns a unique integer ID to it.

4. The response code is 201 and the response body is the created trade object.


Get request to /trades/

1. Return a collection of all trades

2. The response code is 200 and their response body is matching trade object.

3. If there is no trade with the given ID in the collection the response code is 404


DELETE, PUT, PATCH request to /trade/<id>/
The response code is 405.
Because the API does not allow deleting or modifying trades for any ID value
